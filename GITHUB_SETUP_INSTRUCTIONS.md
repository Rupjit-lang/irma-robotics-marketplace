After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with commands. 
**COPY** the HTTPS URL that looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/irma-marketplace.git
```

## Step 3: What to do next

**Reply to this conversation with**:

Example:
```
I created the repository
https://github.com/johnsmith/irma-marketplace.git
```

## Important Notes
